# 🧠 Gargi Kulshreshtha — Data Science Project Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio. This repository showcases projects combining data modeling, analytics, and visualization with both structured and unstructured data systems. These works span domains such as digital entertainment analytics, generative AI, and emergency response optimization. The projects involve end-to-end implementation: from data modeling and querying to Python-based analysis and business insights.

## 🎬 1. Online Streaming Service Subscriber Decline Analysis

**Goal**: Investigate the causes of subscriber attrition across major streaming platforms and provide strategic recommendations.

### 📌 Summary:
- Conducted full lifecycle system design: **EER & UML diagrams**, **relational model mapping**, and dual-database implementation using **MySQL** (structured) and **MongoDB** (semi-structured).
- Wrote complex SQL queries to uncover trends in viewership behavior, billing patterns, device usage, platform issues, and feedback loops.
- Connected Python to MySQL for advanced analytics and generated visuals using **pandas** and **matplotlib**.
- Performed **NoSQL analytics** with MongoDB to explore content ratings, device distribution, and subscriber viewing patterns.

### 🔍 Key Analyses:
- Platforms with the most subscriber issues and lowest content ratings.
- Viewing duration comparisons across genres and subscription types.
- Billing analysis and top-performing plans based on subscriber spending.
- iOS device prevalence and feedback aggregation via map-reduce in MongoDB.

### 💡 Business Impact:
Empowered digital media providers to:
- Identify root causes of churn (technical, content, pricing).
- Prioritize platform improvements and personalized marketing strategies.
- Leverage hybrid database systems for diverse analytics needs.

## 🤖 2. Generative AI Research Network

**Goal**: Visualize and analyze conceptual structures within GPT-generated outputs using network graphs.

### 🧪 Highlights:
- Designed a prompt-response experiment using GPT to generate conceptually related answers across themes.
- Modeled responses as **knowledge graphs**, with nodes representing ideas and edges denoting transitions or semantic similarity.
- Applied **NetworkX** to compute node centrality, detect clusters, and visualize topic flow.
- Analyzed how generative AI sequences and prioritizes ideas based on different prompt structures.

### 📈 Applications:
- Prompt optimization and testing.
- Transparency in large language model outputs.
- Early framework for mapping latent semantics in AI-generated text.

## 🚑 3. Ambulance Allocation Optimization *(Coming Soon)*

**Goal**: Use machine learning and geospatial data to reduce emergency response times in urban environments.

### Planned Implementation:
- Aggregate traffic, incident, and demographic data.
- Apply **PCA**, **k-means clustering**, and **regression** to identify bottleneck regions.
- Design dispatch strategies to minimize wait times and improve resource utilization.
- Visualize model outcomes using **Tableau** or **Folium**.
